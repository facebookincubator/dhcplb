{"name":"apt","version":"5.0.0","description":"Configures apt and apt services. Ships resources for managing apt repositories","long_description":"# apt Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/chef-cookbooks/apt.svg)][travis] [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/apt.svg)][cookbook]\n\nThis cookbook includes recipes to execute apt-get update to ensure the local APT package cache is up to date. There are recipes for managing the apt-cacher-ng caching proxy and proxy clients. It also includes a custom resource for managing APT repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list.d as well as an custom resource for pinning packages via /etc/apt/preferences.d.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Ubuntu 12.04+\n- Debian 7+\n\nMay work with or without modification on other Debian derivatives.\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.1+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- None\n\n## Recipes\n\n### default\n\nThis recipe manually updates the timestamp file used to only run `apt-get update` if the cache is more than one day old.\n\nThis recipe should appear first in the run list of Debian or Ubuntu nodes to ensure that the package cache is up to date before managing any `package` resources with Chef.\n\nThis recipe also sets up a local cache directory for preseeding packages.\n\n**Including the default recipe on a node that does not support apt (such as Windows or RHEL) results in a noop.**\n\n### cacher-client\n\nConfigures the node to use a `apt-cacher-ng` server to cache apt requests. Configuration of the server to use is located in `default['apt']['cacher_client']['cacher_server']` which is a hash containing `host`, `port`, `proxy_ssl`, and `bypass` keys. Example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"apt\": {\n        \"cacher_client\": {\n            \"cacher_server\": {\n                \"host\": \"cache_server.mycorp.dmz\",\n                \"port\": 1234,\n                \"proxy_ssl\": true,\n                \"cache_bypass\": {\n                    \"download.oracle.com\": \"http\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Bypassing the cache\n\nOccasionally you may come across repositories that do not play nicely when the node is using an `apt-cacher-ng` server. You can configure `cacher-client` to bypass the server and connect directly to the repository with the `cache_bypass` attribute.\n\nTo do this, you need to override the `cache_bypass` attribute with an hash of repositories, with each key as the repository URL and value as the protocol to use:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"apt\": {\n        \"cacher_client\": {\n            \"cacher_server\": {\n                \"cache_bypass\": {\n                    \"URL\": \"PROTOCOL\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor example, to prevent caching and directly connect to the repository at `download.oracle.com` via http and the repo at `nginx.org` via https\n\n```json\n{\n    \"apt\": {\n        \"cacher_client\": {\n            \"cacher_server\": {\n                \"cache_bypass\": {\n                    \"download.oracle.com\": \"http\",\n                    \"nginx.org\": \"https\"  \n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### cacher-ng\n\nInstalls the `apt-cacher-ng` package and service so the system can provide APT caching. You can check the usage report at <http://{hostname}:3142/acng-report.html>.\n\nIf you wish to help the `cacher-ng` recipe seed itself, you must now explicitly include the `cacher-client` recipe in your run list **after** `cacher-ng` or you will block your ability to install any packages (ie. `apt-cacher-ng`).\n\n### unattended-upgrades\n\nInstalls and configures the `unattended-upgrades` package to provide automatic package updates. This can be configured to upgrade all packages or to just install security updates by setting `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['allowed_origins']`.\n\nTo pull just security updates, set `origins_patterns` to something like `[\"origin=Ubuntu,archive=trusty-security\"]` (for Ubuntu trusty) or `[\"origin=Debian,label=Debian-Security\"]` (for Debian).\n\n## Attributes\n\n### General\n\n- `['apt']['compile_time_update']` - force the default recipe to run `apt-get update` at compile time.\n- `['apt']['periodic_update_min_delay']` - minimum delay (in seconds) between two actual executions of `apt-get update` by the `execute[apt-get-update-periodic]` resource, default is '86400' (24 hours)\n\n### Caching\n\n- `['apt']['cacher_client']['cacher_server']` - Hash containing server information used by clients for caching. See the example in the recipes section above for the full format of the hash.\n- `['apt']['cacher_interface']` - interface to connect to the cacher-ng service, no default.\n- `['apt']['cacher_port']` - port for the cacher-ng service (used by server recipe only), default is '3142'\n- `['apt']['cacher_dir']` - directory used by cacher-ng service, default is '/var/cache/apt-cacher-ng'\n- `['apt']['compiletime']` - force the `cacher-client` recipe to run before other recipes. It forces apt to use the proxy before other recipes run. Useful if your nodes have limited access to public apt repositories. This is overridden if the `cacher-ng` recipe is in your run list. Default is 'false'\n\n### Unattended Upgrades\n\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['enable']` - enables unattended upgrades, default is false\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['update_package_lists']` - automatically update package list (`apt-get update`) daily, default is true\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['allowed_origins']` - array of allowed apt origins from which to pull automatic upgrades, defaults to a guess at the system's main origin and should almost always be overridden\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['origins_patterns']` - array of allowed apt origin patterns from which to pull automatic upgrades, defaults to none.\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['package_blacklist']` - an array of package which should never be automatically upgraded, defaults to none\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['auto_fix_interrupted_dpkg']` - attempts to repair dpkg state with `dpkg --force-confold --configure -a` if it exits uncleanly, defaults to false (contrary to the unattended-upgrades default)\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['minimal_steps']` - Split the upgrade into the smallest possible chunks. This makes the upgrade a bit slower but it has the benefit that shutdown while a upgrade is running is possible (with a small delay). Defaults to false.\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['install_on_shutdown']` - Install upgrades when the machine is shuting down instead of doing it in the background while the machine is running. This will (obviously) make shutdown slower. Defaults to false.\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['mail']` - Send email to this address for problems or packages upgrades. Defaults to no email.\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['mail_only_on_error']` - If set, email will only be set on upgrade errors. Otherwise, an email will be sent after each upgrade. Defaults to true.\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['remove_unused_dependencies']` Do automatic removal of new unused dependencies after the upgrade. Defaults to false.\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['automatic_reboot']` - Automatically reboots _without confirmation_ if a restart is required after the upgrade. Defaults to false.\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['dl_limit']` - Limits the bandwidth used by apt to download packages. Value given as an integer in kb/sec. Defaults to nil (no limit).\n- `['apt']['unattended_upgrades']['random_sleep]'` - Wait a random number of seconds up to this value before running daily periodic apt actions. System default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).\n\n### Configuration for APT\n\n- `['apt']['confd']['install_recommends']` - Consider recommended packages as a dependency for installing. (default: true)\n- `['apt']['confd']['install_suggests']` - Consider suggested packages as a dependency for installing. (default: false)\n\n## Libraries\n\nThere is an `interface_ipaddress` method that returns the IP address for a particular host and interface, used by the `cacher-client` recipe. To enable it on the server use the `['apt']['cacher_interface']` attribute.\n\n## Resources/Providers\n\n### `apt_repository`\n\nThis LWRP provides an easy way to manage additional APT repositories. Adding a new repository will notify running the `execute[apt-get-update]` resource immediately.\n\n#### Actions\n\n- :add: creates a repository file and builds the repository listing (default)\n- :remove: removes the repository file\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n\n- repo_name: name attribute. The name of the channel to discover\n- uri: the base of the Debian distribution\n- distribution: this is usually your release's codename...ie something like `karmic`, `lucid` or `maverick`\n- components: package groupings... when in doubt use `main`\n- arch: constrain package to a particular arch like `i386`, `amd64` or even `armhf` or `powerpc`. Defaults to nil.\n- trusted: treat all packages from this repository as authenticated regardless of signature\n- deb_src: whether or not to add the repository as a source repo as well - value can be `true` or `false`, default `false`.\n- keyserver: the GPG keyserver where the key for the repo should be retrieved\n- key: if a `keyserver` is provided, this is assumed to be the fingerprint, otherwise it can be either the URI to the GPG key for the repo, or a cookbook_file.\n- key_proxy: if set, pass the specified proxy via `http-proxy=` to GPG.\n- cookbook: if key should be a cookbook_file, specify a cookbook where the key is located for files/default. Defaults to nil, so it will use the cookbook where the resource is used.\n\n#### Examples\n\nAdd the Zenoss repo:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'zenoss' do\n  uri        'http://dev.zenoss.org/deb'\n  components ['main', 'stable']\nend\n```\n\nEnable Ubuntu [multiverse](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu) repositories:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'security-ubuntu-multiverse' do\n  uri          'http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu'\n  distribution 'trusty-security'\n  components   ['multiverse']\n  deb_src      true\nend\n```\n\nAdd the Nginx PPA, autodetect the key and repository url:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'nginx-php' do\n  uri          'ppa:nginx/stable'\n  distribution node['lsb']['codename']\nend\n```\n\nAdd the JuJu PPA, grab the key from the keyserver, and add source repo:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'juju' do\n  uri 'http://ppa.launchpad.net/juju/stable/ubuntu'\n  components ['main']\n  distribution 'trusty'\n  key 'C8068B11'\n  keyserver 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'\n  action :add\n  deb_src true\nend\n```\n\nAdd the Cloudera Repo of CDH4 packages for Ubuntu 12.04 on AMD64:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'cloudera' do\n  uri          'http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh4/ubuntu/precise/amd64/cdh'\n  arch         'amd64'\n  distribution 'precise-cdh4'\n  components   ['contrib']\n  key          'http://archive.cloudera.com/debian/archive.key'\nend\n```\n\nRemove Zenoss repo:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'zenoss' do\n  action :remove\nend\n```\n\n### `apt_preference`\n\nThis LWRP provides an easy way to pin packages in /etc/apt/preferences.d. Although apt-pinning is quite helpful from time to time please note that Debian does not encourage its use without thorough consideration.\n\nFurther information regarding apt-pinning is available via <http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences>.\n\n#### Actions\n\n- :add: creates a preferences file under /etc/apt/preferences.d\n- :remove: Removes the file, therefore unpin the package\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n\n- package_name: name attribute. The name of the package\n- glob: Pin by glob() expression or regexp surrounded by /.\n- pin: The package version/repository to pin\n- pin_priority: The pinning priority aka \"the highest package version wins\"\n\n#### Examples\n\nPin libmysqlclient16 to version 5.1.49-3:\n\n```ruby\napt_preference 'libmysqlclient16' do\n  pin          'version 5.1.49-3'\n  pin_priority '700'\nend\n```\n\nUnpin libmysqlclient16:\n\n```ruby\napt_preference 'libmysqlclient16' do\n  action :remove\nend\n```\n\nPin all packages from dotdeb.org:\n\n```ruby\napt_preference 'dotdeb' do\n  glob         '*'\n  pin          'origin packages.dotdeb.org'\n  pin_priority '700'\nend\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nPut `recipe[apt]` first in the run list. If you have other recipes that you want to use to configure how apt behaves, like new sources, notify the execute resource to run, e.g.:\n\n```ruby\ntemplate '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/my_apt_sources.list' do\n  notifies :run, 'execute[apt-get update]', :immediately\nend\n```\n\nThe above will run during execution phase since it is a normal template resource, and should appear before other package resources that need the sources in the template.\n\nPut `recipe[apt::cacher-ng]` in the run_list for a server to provide APT caching and add `recipe[apt::cacher-client]` on the rest of the Debian-based nodes to take advantage of the caching server.\n\nIf you want to cleanup unused packages, there is also the `apt-get autoclean` and `apt-get autoremove` resources provided for automated cleanup.\n\n## License & Authors\n\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2009-2016, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n[cookbook]: https://community.chef.io/cookbooks/apt\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/apt\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"compat_resource":">= 12.14.7"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"apt::default":"Runs apt-get update during compile phase and sets up preseed directories","apt::cacher-ng":"Set up an apt-cacher-ng caching proxy","apt::cacher-client":"Client for the apt::cacher-ng caching proxy"}}
