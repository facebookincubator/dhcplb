# compat_resource cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/compat_resource.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/compat_resource) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/compat_resource.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/compat_resource)

This cookbook backports functionality introduced in the latest chef-client releases to any chef-client from 12.1 onwards. This includes [Custom Resource](https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources.html) functionality, notification improvements, as well as new resources added to core chef. It allows for the usage of these new resources in cookbooks without requiring the very latest Chef client release.

## Backported functionality

- [Custom Resources](https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources.html)
- [apt_repository](https://docs.chef.io/resource_apt_repository.html)
- [apt_update](https://docs.chef.io/resource_apt_update.html)
- [systemd_unit](https://docs.chef.io/resource_systemd_unit.html)
- [yum_repository](https://docs.chef.io/resource_yum_repository.html)
- [:before notifications](https://docs.chef.io/resources.html#timers)

## Requirements

### Platforms

- All platforms supported by Chef

### Chef

## Usage

To use this cookbook, put `depends 'compat_resource'` in the metadata.rb of your cookbook. Once this is done, you can use all the new custom resource features to define resources. It Just Works.
